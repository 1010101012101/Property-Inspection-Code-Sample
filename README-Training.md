# Property Management Code Sample

## Training

Here are several training videos you can watch about the Property Management Code Sample.

**End to end demo scenario**

You can watch an entire end to end demo of the sample in the following video.  If you are looking to see everything this code sample does and all the pieces of the Office 365 platform it uses then this is the video you want to watch.

**Slide deck**

The [PowerPoint slide deck](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Property-Inspection-Code-Sample/blob/master/Documents/Demo%20Script.pptx) describes how to prep your environment with sample data and execute the sample scenario end to end.  It also describes all of the different places where data is created or updated throughout the entire scenario.  This is an another excellent resource to see what this demo really does and how the scenario in it unfolds.

***Provisioning***

This two part video series describes how all of the components which make up the code sample are provisioned to Office 365. In the code sample, we provision 36 different things to the Office 365 tenancy and AAD! Given the fact the platform was just released this is pretty amazing and shows how robust the APIs already are.

***Android***

This two part video series walks you through how to make a native Android application that authenticates to AAD and uses Office 365 services including SharePoint lists, document libraries, OneNote, Office 365 Groups, Exchange, the Office 365 Video Portal, and much more! This series of videos starts out by showing you how to start from scratch to make an Android app that uses Office 365 services, then it jumps into the Property Management Code Sample and shows you all of the code that is used for authentication and interacting with all the Office 365 services.

***iOS***

This two part video series follows the same pattern as the Android series. It also discusses how to use the [Microsoft Office REST Client for iOS (MS ORC)](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/orc-for-ios) to access Office 365 REST Services from native iOS applications.

**Ignite 2015 Conference Session**

You can also see the demo in action in the **Office Development Matters, and Here's Why...** session from Ignite 2015.

[![Office Development Matters, and Here's Why...](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Property-Inspection-Code-Sample/blob/master/Documents/office_dev_matters.png)](http://channel9.msdn.com/events/Ignite/2015/FND2202 "Click to see the sample in action.")

> Speakers: [Tristan Davis](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/tristan-davis), [Rob Lefferts](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/robert-lefferts), [Jeremy Thake](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Jeremy-Thake)

> Jeremy provides a tour of the Property Manager web app and the pieces of Office 365 it is built on.

**Build 2015 Conference Sessions**

You can see the demo in action and learn more about the code in the following sessions from //build 2015.

[![Integrating Web Apps with Office 365](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Property-Inspection-Code-Sample/blob/master/Documents/integrating-web-apps-with-office-365.png)](http://channel9.msdn.com/events/Build/2015/3-728 "Click to see the sample in action.")

> Speakers: [Todd Baginski](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Todd-Baginski), [Dorrene Brown](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/dorrene-brown)

> Todd and Dorrene show how to make an Office 365 web app from the ground up and explain the fundamental concepts.  Then, Todd demonstrates the web app portion of the Property Management code sample and dives deep into the code to show how the ASP.NET MVC web site is built and how it uses Office 365 and the Office 365 Unified API to integrate with the Office 365 platform and services.

> Speakers: [Todd Baginski](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Todd-Baginski), [Joshua Gavant](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/joshua-gavant)

> Todd demonstrates the iOS repair app at the end of this session and shows how it may be used to take a picture and upload it to a private site collection in Office 365.

The [MS Open Tech](http://msopentech.com)'s open source SDKs are used to integrate the iOS and Android apps with several Office 365 services.

- [Microsoft Services SDKs for iOS](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-365-SDK-for-iOS/)
- [Microsoft Services SDKs for Android](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-365-SDK-for-android/)
